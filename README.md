1. merge sort can be used on sorting linkedlist, stable, o(n) space

2. merge sort and quick sort is widely used 

3. Interpolation search: the input is ordered. similar to binary search.
    mid = low + (key - arr[low])*((high - low)/(arr[high] - arr[low]))
    O(log(log(n))) when the array is unifomly distributed

4. stable sort: insertion sort, merge sort, bubble sort
    unstable sort: heap sort, quick sort

5. worst case for quick sort id O(n^2) but heapsort and merge
    sort are O(nlogn) 

6. cycle sort: for each element count how many element is less than it
    and put it to the right place. Cycle sort makes leat number of write.

7. range from 0 to n^2 -1 can be represented using base n(two digits).
    45 using base 7 = 63 

8. counting sort, count the number first, then for each i,
    count[i] += count[i-1], get the position of the number
